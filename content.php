             <p>Welcome to the official site of ”Ett jävla bilspel”, translated to english it goes something like ”A fucking cargame”.
                Born out of the minds of four university students, “Ett jävla bilspel” is a racing game for Android and iOS.
                The game mixes the elements of graphics and gameplay of older, classic racing games with the modern technology of the smartphones.
                It consequently makes the game fun and interesting for a wide audience.</p>

             <br />

             <p>In game you steer your car on the never ending highway running through different kinds of exotic locations.
                But beware, everything isn’t fun and games. Every now and then obstacles in form of suicidal animals or constructions pop up and you will have to avoid them, or else you crash. You snooze, you lose.
                But If you’re a good enough a driver to avoid them, you’ll be rewarded with points increasing the further you drive.
                But the further you drive, the faster it’ll go, and the difficulty will increase.
                Since the road never ends, the one who can survive the hard life on the road the longest gets the most points.
                Top scores from all over the world are shown on this site. Try getting there.
                On your way to the highest score around, don’t forget to pick up powerups along the dangerous highway. Why not run over a speedboost to go faster? Or pick up a spraycan to swap your vehicles colors?
